# Welcome to The OSS Hive (working title)

[I SHOULD EVENTUALLY ADD A LOGO HERE]

Getting started with OSS should be trivial by now, but while getting the first easy PR is... well, easy, moving on from there is not.
Picking the right project to contribute can be a daunting task:

- Where do you look for it?
- How can you look for projects using technology you know?
- How can you tell if the project is looking for help?
- Is the project you're looking at actively being maintained or has it been abandoned years ago?
- Are the maintainers paying attention to outside PRs?

And the questions pile up. 
If you're a project owner (or a Startup with an OSS project), you might be looking for help. But how can you find those developers? Cold outreach barely works, you get ignored, especially if you're starting out with a project with 0 stars.

The Hive (working title) attempts to be a central place for OSS contributors to meet and easily find OSS projects.
And at the same time, for OSS projects to find active and eager contributors.

## Pending features
This project is actively being developed. Here is the list of features required for the MVP to go live as an early Alpha:

- ‚úÖ Start saving user information into DB
- ‚úÖ Create user profile page

- ‚è± Define search engine stack
- ‚è± Index project data into search engine
- ‚è± Add ability to search for projects
- ‚è± Start processing project data daily and generate metrics

## Contributing
This project is still in early development. If you'd still like to contribute, by all means fork the repo and send a PR, but first reach out to me and let's discuss what you're looking to add.
Once the project grows, I'll start adding a more formal process to handle contributions.

## Licensing
TBD, still looking into it, soon to be updated.
